## Cat no Arguments
I got no results from this code. I got that because 'cat' shows what is in a file or a folder. Because it has no reference there is nothing to show. This is not an error.

## Cat file Argument
I got nothing when I ran this code. This is because I didn't put anything inside the file I was using. There was nothing there so the code showed nothing. This is an error because it should have said it was a file.

## Cat folder Argument
When I coded this command it says 'is directory'. This is beacuse 'cat' shows you what is in the folder or files you select. There is no error.

## CD no Arguments
There was nothing when I used this command. CD needs an argument in order to work at all because it looks inside that argument to get the result. There was no error in this code.

## CD file Argument
When I did this it says 'Not a directory'. It says that because the CD command is used to focus on a directory not a file. This was the correct result, no error.

## CD folder Argument
When I ran this code it created another line in the terminal. It created this line in order to focus on what is inside the directory that was opened. Now it will only work in that directory. This is the correct action, there was no error.

## LS no Arguments
This printed out the result 'folderExample' and 'here.txt'. This is because both of thoes are contained in the entire code. LS shows you what whatever you selected contains. There was no error.

## LS file Argument
ls file example says 'file example'. It says that because it is showing what files are in a directory and a file isn't a directory. There was no error with this.

## LS folder Argument
When I did this it said 'insideFolder.java'. This was shown because 'insideFolder' is inside the folder I put in the code. LS shows what each directory contains. This code doesn't contain an error.
