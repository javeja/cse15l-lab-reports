# No Arguments
I got no results from this code. I got that because 'cat' shows what is in a file or a folder. Because it has no reference there is nothing to show. This is not an error.

# File Argument
I got nothing when I ran this code. This is because I didn't put anything inside the file I was using. There was nothing there so the code showed nothing. This is an error because it should have said it was a file.

# Folder Argument
In this code it says 'folderExample: Is a directory'. It is telling me what the folderExample is, a folder or directory. This is not an error.
